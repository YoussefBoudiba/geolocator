# Geolocator

The **Geolocator** app is a multi target application using several **BTP** (Business Technologie Platform)/open source services and technologies.

## Branches


The main branch consist of the full working application with a **MTA** descriptor file for the deployment to your BTP subaccount.

If you are interested in building the application using a step by step approach, please use the branches starting from **1-geolocator**.
